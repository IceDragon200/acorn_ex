# Identity

Identity can either be an address: `node-name@node-domain-or-ip:port` or just the `domain-or-ip:port` pair.

* `192.168.0.1:7077`
* `acme-corp@192.168.0.1:7077`
* `acme.example.com:7077`
* `acme-corp@acme.example.com:7077`

Note, port is MANDATORY currently as Acorn does not have a default assumed port.
